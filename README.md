> 'Connect 4 its a two-player connection game in which the players take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The object of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.'

- The game displays the winner if a player connects four discs horizontally.

## Learning Goals / Areas of Focus

- Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Structures & Algorithms

## Extra Learning Goals / Areas of Focus

- Use Ruby to build a command line application
- Practice breaking a program into logical components
- Use Ruby's built-in Hash class to store board state
- Use enumerable to iterate over multi-dimensional collections (arrays of hashes, in this case)
- Use conditionals to build the game logic
- Use methods to encapsulate game logic
- Use git frequently with descriptive commit messages
